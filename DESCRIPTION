Description: Convex Least Squares Programming (CLSP) is a two-step estimator 
    for solving underdetermined, ill-posed, or structurally constrained 
    least-squares problems. It combines pseudoinverse-based estimation with 
    convex-programming correction methods inspired by Lasso, Ridge, and 
    Elastic Net to ensure numerical stability, constraint enforcement, and 
    interpretability. The package also provides numerical stability analysis 
    and CLSP-specific diagnostics, including partial R^2, normalized RMSE 
    (NRMSE), Monte Carlo t-tests for mean NRMSE, and condition-number-based 
    confidence bands.
