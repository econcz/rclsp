Description: 
    Convex Least Squares Programming (CLSP) is a two-step estimator for solving 
    underdetermined, ill-posed, or structurally constrained least-squares 
    problems. It combines pseudoinverse-based estimation with convex-programming 
    correction methods inspired by Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net to ensure 
    numerical stability, constraint enforcement, and interpretability. The 
    package also provides numerical stability analysis and CLSP-specific 
    diagnostics, including partial R^2, normalized RMSE (NRMSE), Monte Carlo 
    t-tests for mean NRMSE, and condition-number-based confidence bands.
